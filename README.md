# pmmBackupRestore
This is a work in progress but the ultimate goal of this utility is to be able to automate the backing up of a PMM regardless of being dockerized, OVF or AMI.  This is also intended to be run while PMM is still running as the current backup procedure wants PMM stopped and all databases quiesced. 

Final goal is to be able to use the same utility in reverse to take a backup and restore it to a different PMM server of the same version.
